# Solidity Versus Yul
### Learn Yul by Doing
The best way to learn is by doing, just like it is said that repetition is the key to mastery. This is a repo where I am playing around with Yul by replicating solidity codes with a corresponding Yul implementation.

### Testing
You can test the contracts using <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/">Remix</a>. Solidity contracts written in Yul runs perfectly on Remix.

### Caution
Be sure of what you are doing before using Yul (Inline Assembly) in production => This is for learning(educational) purpose.
