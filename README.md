# Solidity Versus Yul
### Learn Yul by Doing
The best way to learn is by doing, just like it is said that repitition is the key to mastery. This is a repo where I am playing around with Yul by replication solidity codes with a corresponding Yul implementation.

### Caution
Be sure of what you are doing before using Yul (Inline Assembly) in production => This is for learning(educational) purpose.
